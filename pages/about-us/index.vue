      <h3>A Safe Place Since 2004</h3>
      <p>Welcome to Centro MiLA, where we stand as a beacon of hope and support for women and children facing domestic violence
        in Milan. Since our opening in 2004, we have been a steadfast ally for women and children facing domestic violence. Our
          journey began with a small team of dedicated individuals who believed in the transformative power of compassion and advocacy.
          Over the years, we have grown into a comprehensive center, offering a wide array of services designed to empower and uplift
            those affected by domestic violence. As a cornerstone of the community, we strive to create a safe and supportive environment
            where survivors can heal, grow, and thrive.</p>

        <h3>MiLA's History</h3>
        <p>Centro MiLA’s roots run deep. Initially, we operated from a single location in Milan, a safe haven for a handful of women 
          seeking refuge. Those early days were marked by determination, empathy, and a shared commitment to making a difference. As the 
          years passed, our impact grew. And after eight years of tireless work, we expanded our reach by opening a second location. This 
          strategic move allowed us to be more present in the territory, reaching even more women in need. The second center became a 
          beacon of hope, a place where survivors found solace, legal assistance, and emotional support.</p>
        <p>Our history is woven with stories of resilience, courage, and transformation. We’ve weathered storms, celebrated victories, 
          and learned from every step along the way.
          Each survivor who has walked through our doors has left an indelible mark on our journey, reminding us of the urgency and 
          importance of our work</p>
