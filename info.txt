The public/ directory in a Nuxt 3 project  is used to store static files that are served directly by the web server without any processing by the application.
These files are accessible from the root of your application's domain. For example, if your application is hosted at http://example.com, then the files in the public/ directory would be accessible at http://example.com/filename.

The favicon.ico file is a specific type of static file that represents the favicon
(the small icon that appears in the browser tab next to your website's title).
